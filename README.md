libWyvernzora
=============

My personal .Net library. A Big Bunch Of Stuff.

This is not a major project. Most of the library was completed two years ago, I'm just gradually moving code from personal SVN to github, that's it.
One of the reasons I'm moving it now is because I'm extremely dissatisfied with my implementation of networking in TaskOptimizer project, and I mean to create a much better version of it very very very soon. In order to do that I need my old code and most of libWyvernzora classes.
So...nah, this library won't be completely moved here. Not until I get done with TaskOptimizer.
