libWyvernzora
=============

**libWyvernzora** is my personal library with a big bunch of stuff that comes in handy whenever I code something.

A very big chunk of code in libWyvernzora is re-implementation of Firefly Framework by F.R.C., but I am constantly making improvements over it. This library will eventually include everything I would ever need to reuse from my older projects: data structures, extension methods, custom services and much more.

Right now this library is still work in progress.
